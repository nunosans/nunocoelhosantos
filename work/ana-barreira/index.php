    <h2>Ana Barreira</h2>
    <h6>Branding, Print &amp; Web Design.</h6>
    <p>
      This was my first fashion related project, which is now a big subject of
      my work. Ana Barreira is a talented fashion photographer graduated from
      the <a href="http://www.fashion.arts.ac.uk/" target="_blank">London
      College of Fashion</a> with an impressive portfolio. I approached her to
      help promote her work.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not a requirement, and certainly not a straight-forward task, to
      come up with an identity for Ana. She would describe herself as belonging
      to the fashion world, but at the same time against it. The concept
      explores this characteristic and uses the capital “V” from
      <a href="http://www.vogue.co.uk/" target="_blank">Vogue</a> magazine
      inverted to create a capital “A”. This followed a whole custom typeface to
      create the identity.

      The website was developed by <a href="http://twitter.com/alvesjtiago"
      target="_blank">Tiago Alves</a>. I wanted this site to be stunning from
      the very first page and very easy to navigate around. The design lines
      follow the angle of the capital “A” and the italicized menu items fit into
      this trend.
